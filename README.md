# IAB207 Rapid Web Development

IAB207 Rapid Web Development - Semester 2 - 2019 - QUT

Create a functioning frontend and backend for a marketplace selling items of our choosings.

Here we have a marketplace *My Tunes* for buying and selling music. Users can create unique login details to start selling their items and buying from others on the marketplace.

*My Tunes* does not integrate any form of payment - this is designed to be left up to the seller and buyer through either phone or email. The buyer can then select a user they wish the sell the item to and the item will be made no longer available to bid on.
